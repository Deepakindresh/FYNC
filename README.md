## FYNC (For Your Need and Care)

FYNC is an e-commerce project built on the idea of providing customers with the freedom of online shopping of daily groceries without having to step out of their homes. This project also aimed to reduce long queues at the markets, especially in the pandemic situation, and boost the shopkeeper's sales. This eradicates the fear of covid among customers and gives an opportunity for the shop keepers to advertise in online platforms.
